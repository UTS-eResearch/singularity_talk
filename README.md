# Singularity Tutorial

This is a tutorial for a short course on using singularity.

## Files

 - singularity.html -- The HTML tutorial.
 - styles.css -- 
 - centos7.def -- An example Singularity recipe that you can use as a base 
   for your own build of a Singularity container.

## Reveal.js Framework 

I am using the reveal.js HTML presentation framework, a demo of which can be seen at 
its homepage <https://revealjs.com>

To use this you need to clone its GIT repo into a local directory as its not
included in this repo. Be in the same directory as this README.md and do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
    
This will have created the directory `reveal.js`. The links in the singularity.html file
reference files in this directory.
